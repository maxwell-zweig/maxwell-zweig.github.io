I am a junior majoring in Mathematics with a concentration in mathematics and a minor in computer science. On this website you will find projects that I am/have worked on. My research interests include:
* MLE for stochastic processes
* Optimal Control
* Neural Networks for Solving PDEs

I am particularly interested in applications to the financial markets and environment and sustainability, and am looking for an internship and/or research for summer 2024.
